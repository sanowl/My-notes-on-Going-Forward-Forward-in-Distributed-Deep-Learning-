| Objective                                           | Introduce a novel approach to distributed deep learning using Geoffrey Hinton’s Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm.  |
| Methodology                                         | The FF algorithm uses dual forward passes instead of traditional forward and backward passes in backpropagation. |

| Results                                             | Achieved a 3.75x speedup on the MNIST dataset without compromising accuracy.                                      |

#### Introduction:

| **Cues/Keywords**                                   | **Main Notes**                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Challenges with Backpropagation                     | Sequential nature, dependency on gradients, high communication overhead.                                          |
| Sequential Nature                                   | Each layer must wait for gradient updates from the next layer, causing delays in distributed settings.           |
| Dependency and Synchronization                      | Gradient of each layer depends on the next layer, requiring extensive synchronization between nodes.             |
| Communication Overhead                              | Constant communication between nodes for gradient and weight transfer, burdensome for large-scale networks.      |
| Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm                      | Uses local, layer-wise computations and dual forward passes (positive and negative) to update weights.           |
| Local Computations                                  | Each layer is trained independently, reducing dependencies.                                                      |
| Dual Forward Passes                                 | Positive pass increases the "goodness" of real data, negative pass decreases the "goodness" of negative data.    |
| Biological Plausibility                             | Inspired by the brain’s processing mechanisms, making it more plausible than traditional backpropagation.         |

|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Existing Distributed Training Frameworks            | PipeDream, GPipe, Local Parallelism.                                                                              |
| PipeDream                                           | Combines data, pipeline, and model parallelism but still relies on backpropagation, leading to efficiency issues. |
| GPipe                                               | Similar to PipeDream, uses synchronous weight updates during the backward pass.                                   |
| Local Parallelism                                   | Divides network into blocks, trains independently, but local loss may not align with the global objective.         |
| Forward-Forward Algorithm by Geoffrey Hinton        | Trains each layer independently using positive and negative passes, reducing dependencies.                       |
| Goodness Function                                   | Measures sum of squares of neuron activities; positive pass increases goodness for real data, negative pass decreases for negative data. |
